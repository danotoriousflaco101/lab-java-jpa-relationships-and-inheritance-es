1. Three tasks that can be done with native SQL but are difficult or impossible with JPQL:

• Using database-specific functions (like window or analytical functions).
• Executing DDL statements (like creating or altering tables).
• Performing very complex joins or subqueries not supported by JPQL.


2. Why prefer using native SQL in real-world projects?

•	Provides more control for complex queries.
•	Allows the use of database-specific features not supported by JPQL.
•	Useful when working with existing optimized SQL code.
